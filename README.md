# 3DS Chess

A chess game for the Nintendo 3DS

Mainly a challenge for myself, building a chess engine within the restraints of
the 3DS hardware. Plus, building a game that can play solo, locally, AND online
would be AMAZING.

Inspired by Sebastian Lague's video about building a chess bot, and a LOT of
hyperfixation.

## Engine Debugger

Mainly meant for development purposes, a way to see into the internals of the
engine without fiddling with a 3DS or emulator. This and the UCI interface will
be built if you aren't using a 3DS CMake toolchain.
